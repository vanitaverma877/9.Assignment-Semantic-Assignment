Q2.What are semantic tags? Give a couple of examples.

A.**Semantic tags** are HTML elements that clearly describe their meaning 
    in a human- and machine-readable way. Unlike non-semantic elements 
    (such as `<div>` and `<span>`), semantic tags indicate the role of 
    the content they contain, making the structure of the webpage more 
    understandable for browsers, search engines, and developers.

### **Benefits of Semantic Tags**
1. **Improved Accessibility**: Screen readers and other assistive 
     technologies can better understand the structure of the content, which 
     improves accessibility for users with disabilities.
2. **Better SEO**: Search engines can more easily parse and understand 
     the content, improving search rankings.
3. **Maintainability**: Semantic tags make the code more readable and 
     maintainable for developers.
4. **Standardization**: These tags help standardize the structure of 
     webpages, creating a more consistent user experience across different sites.

### **Examples of Semantic Tags**

1. **`<header>`**
   - **Purpose**: Represents the header section of a document or a section.
   - **Example**:
     ```html
     <header>
       <h1>Website Title</h1>
       <nav>
         <ul>
           <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
           <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
           <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
         </ul>
       </nav>
     </header>
     ```

2. **`<nav>`**
   - **Purpose**: Represents a section of the page intended for navigation links.
   - **Example**:
     ```html
     <nav>
       <ul>
         <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
         <li><a href="#">Services</a></li>
         <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
       </ul>
     </nav>
     ```

3. **`<article>`**
   - **Purpose**: Represents independent, self-contained content, such as 
a blog post or news article.
   - **Example**:
     ```html
     <article>
       <h2>Blog Post Title</h2>
       <p>This is the content of the blog post.</p>
     </article>
     ```

4. **`<section>`**
   - **Purpose**: Defines a section in a document, often with a thematic 
       grouping of content, usually with a heading.
   - **Example**:
     ```html
     <section>
       <h2>Our Services</h2>
       <p>Details about the services we offer.</p>
     </section>
     ```

5. **`<footer>`**
   - **Purpose**: Represents the footer of a document or section, typically 
       containing copyright information, links, and contact details.
   - **Example**:
     ```html
     <footer>
       <p>&copy; 2024 My Website. All rights reserved.</p>
     </footer>
     ```

6. **`<aside>`**
   - **Purpose**: Represents content that is indirectly related to the main 
       content, like a sidebar or additional information.
   - **Example**:
     ```html
     <aside>
       <h3>Related Articles</h3>
       <ul>
         <li><a href="#">Article 1</a></li>
         <li><a href="#">Article 2</a></li>
       </ul>
     </aside>
     ```

### **Non-Semantic Tags vs. Semantic Tags**
- **Non-Semantic Tags**: `<div>`, `<span>` — These tags do not convey 
    any information about their content.
- **Semantic Tags**: `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, `<section>` 
— These tags provide meaning and context to the content they enclose.
